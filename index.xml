      <description>I am a recent graduate from the university of St Andrews where I studied Artificial Intelligence. From the degree I learnt a lot about traditional AI systems which involves search, logic as well as probability. I also learnt a lot about machine learning and deep learning architectures which include convolutional, recurrent and generative adversarial neural networks. I also picked up a course in Distributed and Data intensive Systems where I convered topics that has to do with several operating and distributed architectures.</description>
