      <description>St Andrews is a unique city in Scotland and more or less the world. This place has a lot of color and unique personalities. I enjoyed my time in this place as it embraces the idea of learning. The people here are amazing with distinct and creative personlities, a multicultural avenue that opens up your mind to different parts of the world through the eyes of others and I enjoyed being there learning alot about Artificial Intelligence and also the people.</description>
